# Data-Driven-Pressure System (APS)-sensor-fault-detection
The Air Pressure System (APS) is a critical subsystem in heavy-duty commercial vehicles, responsible for generating pressurized air used for braking, gear shifting, and other pneumatic operations. Reliable APS performance is essential for vehicle safety, and failures can lead to costly repairs or operational downtime.
