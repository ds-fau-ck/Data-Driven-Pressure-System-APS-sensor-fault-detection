# Data-Driven-Air-Pressure System (APS)-sensor-fault-detection
The Air Pressure System (APS) is a critical subsystem in heavy-duty commercial vehicles, responsible for generating pressurized air used for braking, gear shifting, and other pneumatic operations. Reliable APS performance is essential for vehicle safety, and failures can lead to costly repairs or operational downtime.

This project focuses on developing a binary classification model that determines whether a vehicle failure is caused by a specific component within the APS. The positive class represents failures directly linked to this APS component, while the negative class represents failures originating from other unrelated vehicle components.
The overarching goal is to support maintenance decision-making and reduce unnecessary repair expenses by accurately identifying APS-related faults.
